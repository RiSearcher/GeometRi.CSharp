# GeometRi
### Simple and lightweight computational geometry library for .Net

Main purpose of the GeometRi library is manipulations with basic
geometrical primitives, such as point, line, plane, sphere, triangle in 3D space:
translation and rotation operations, distance calculation, intersections,
orthogonal projections of one object into another, etc. The objects can be defined
in global or in one of the local coordinate systems and converted form one coordinate
system into another.

The library was build to be as simple and intuitive as posible. Users do not have to remember the reference coordinate
system of each object. The objects store the coordinate system they are defined in and all transformations
will be caried out implicitly when necessary.  

The main goal was simplisity and readability of the code, therefore speed and robustness was not a priority.
Global tolerance property is used for proximity checking, not an exact robust algorithms.

Rotation in 3D space defined in global or local reference frame (internally represented by rotation matrix)
### Properties
* __Coord__ - reference coordinate system
* __ToAxis__ - axis of rotation in reference coordinate system
* __ToAngle__ - angle of rotation in reference coordinate system
* __ToRotationMatrix__ - rotation matrix
* __ToQuaternion__ - convert to quaternion
### Methods
* __Copy__ - Creates copy of the object
* __ConvertTo__ - convert rotation to local coordinate system
* __ConvertToGlobal__ - convert rotation to global coordinate system
* __Mult__ - apply rotation to point or vector
* __ToEulerAngles__ - factor rotation matrix as product of three elemental rotations
* __Equals__ - check if two rotations are equals
* __ToString__ - string representation of rotation in global or local coordinate system
### Static methods
* __FromEulerAngles__ - creates rotation object from Euler or Tait-Bryan angles
* __SLERP__ - Spherical Linear intERPolation of two rotations

## GeometRi3D

### Properties
